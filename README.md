# Ocean_Navigation_System_CSharp_ConsoleBased
In ocean navigation, locations are measured in degrees and minutes of latitude and longitude. Thus if you’re lying off the mouth of Papete Harbor in Tahiti, your location is 149 degrees 34.8 minutes west longitude, and 17 degrees 31.5 minutes south latitude. This is written as 149°34.8’ W, 17°31.5’ S. There are 60 minutes in a degree. (An older system also divided a minute into 60 seconds, but the modern approach is to use decimal minutes instead.) Longitude is measured from 0 to 180 degrees, east or west from Greenwich, England, to the international dateline in the Pacific. Latitude is measured from 0 to 90 degrees, north or south from the equator to the poles.
